    <div class="div1">
    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Air Quality:</span> The air quality in Gorno-Badakhshan is moderate, with an AQI fluctuating between 30 and 50, largely impacted by occasional dust storms from high-altitude winds. These dust events can affect visibility and reduce air quality temporarily, but overall conditions remain within safe limits for farming and outdoor activitie.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div1">
    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Precipitation (IMERG):</span>The region receives moderate rainfall, averaging 30-40 cm annually, supplemented by consistent snowmelt from surrounding mountains. This combination provides a stable water source for irrigation, though farmers should be mindful of potential fluctuations later in the season as snowmelt decreases.</p>

    <div class="div1">
    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Soil Moisture (SMAP):</span>SMAP data indicates that soil moisture levels are satisfactory, typically around 20-30%, which supports healthy crop growth. However, localized dry patches may emerge during periods of reduced precipitation or in areas that receive less water from snowmelt. Farmers should focus on irrigation to maintain consistent soil moisture</p>

    <div class="div1">
    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Vegetation Growth (MODIS):</span>The region receives moderate rainfall, averaging 30-40 cm annually, supplemented by consistent snowmelt from surrounding mountains. This combination provides a stable water source for irrigation, though farmers should be mindful of potential fluctuations later in the season as snowmelt decreases. MODIS imagery shows healthy vegetation growth across most of Gorno-Badakhshan, although some areas exhibit minor stress due to environmental variability and dust storms. These stress signals can usually be mitigated with timely interventions, such as improved irrigation or adjusting fertilizer inputs.</p>

        <summary class="sum1">Detailed Information</summary>
        <p class="p4">Air Quality:</p>
        <p class="p5">The air quality in Sughd is moderate, with an AQI ranging around 28, indicating relatively clean air for most of the year【26†source】【27†source】. However, Sughd is prone to occasional dust storms due to its proximity to desert areas. These storms can lead to short-term increases in dust particles, reducing visibility and impacting crop health by temporarily limiting the amount of sunlight available for photosynthesis. During such dust events, farmers should take precautionary measures, such as covering sensitive crops or delaying outdoor work until air quality improves. Monitoring local air quality reports can help mitigate the short-term impact of these dust storms.</p>
        <p class="p4">Precipitation (IMERG):</p>
        <p class="p5">According to IMERG data, Sughd receives an annual average of 25-30 cm of rainfall, slightly below the regional norm【36†source】【37†source】. Although the region benefits from steady rainfall during certain months, it experiences extended dry periods that require effective irrigation to support crop growth. IMERG data suggests that rainfall is insufficient to sustain crops without additional water inputs, especially during peak dry months. Farmers should prioritize water conservation techniques, such as rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation, to ensure that crops remain hydrated even when precipitation levels are low.</p>
        <p class="p4">Soil Moisture (SMAP):</p>
        <p class="p5">Soil moisture in Sughd typically hovers around 20-30%, which is generally sufficient for farming but fluctuates depending on local rainfall and irrigation practices【38†source】. SMAP data indicates that soil moisture levels can drop significantly during periods of low rainfall, particularly in areas with poor irrigation infrastructure. To maintain optimal moisture levels, farmers should rely on SMAP data to track soil conditions and adjust their irrigation schedules accordingly. This will help avoid water stress in crops, which could otherwise lead to stunted growth and reduced yields.</p>
        <p class="p4">Vegetation Growth (MODIS):</p>
        <p class="p5">MODIS satellite imagery reveals that vegetation growth in Sughd is generally healthy, although certain areas show signs of mild stress due to water shortages during dry spells【39†source】. This stress is usually localized, with crops in better-irrigated areas faring well. Farmers can use MODIS data to monitor their fields regularly, identifying problem areas where crops may need additional water or nutrients. Early detection of vegetation stress allows for timely interventions, helping to maximize productivity and ensure uniform growth across fields.</p>
        <p class="p4">Temperature:</p>
        <p class="p5">Sughd experiences warm summers, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C. These conditions are favorable for a variety of crops, including cotton, wheat, and fruits like apricots. However, high summer temperatures can exacerbate water loss through evaporation, especially during the hottest months. Farmers should monitor temperatures closely and adjust irrigation practices to prevent soil from drying out too quickly. Cooler temperatures in the spring and fall allow for extended growing seasons, giving farmers flexibility in crop rotation and planting schedules.</p>
        <p class="p4">Flood and Drought Monitoring:</p>
        <p class="p5">The Sughd region is at low risk for flooding but faces occasional droughts during long dry seasons. According to Landsat and ECOSTRESS data, Sughd has seen increased periods of drought over the past decade, which have impacted water availability for farming【36†source】【38†source】. Farmers can use these tools to monitor potential drought conditions and plan their water use accordingly. By tracking regional precipitation and soil moisture data, farmers can better predict when droughts are likely to occur and implement water-saving techniques before conditions worsen.</p>
        <p class="p4">Evapotranspiration:</p>
        <p class="p5">Sughd's hot summers contribute to higher evapotranspiration rates, particularly during peak heat months, when water loss through evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants increases【39†source】. Using data from ECOSTRESS and MODIS, farmers can monitor these evapotranspiration rates and adjust irrigation accordingly to compensate for water loss. Proper irrigation scheduling during high-evapotranspiration periods can help prevent crops from becoming water-stressed, thereby maintaining healthy growth.</p>
        <p class="p4">Overall Condition:</p>
        <p class="p5">Moderate conditions. Farming in Sughd is generally feasible, but careful management of water resources is essential. Dust storms, while temporary, can cause disruptions, and the region's slightly below-average rainfall means that efficient irrigation systems are critical to sustaining crops. By utilizing data from IMERG, SMAP, and MODIS, farmers can monitor soil moisture, crop health, and water availability to optimize their farming practices. Implementing water conservation techniques and monitoring satellite data will help farmers navigate environmental challenges and maximize their crop yields throughout the growing season.</p>
