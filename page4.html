    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Air Quality:</span> Air quality in DRS is generally moderate, with occasional pollution spikes due to nearby industrial activity, particularly in urban areas. While the AQI typically remains between 50-100, short-term pollution spikes may require farmers to limit outdoor work during peak periods. Overall, conditions are acceptable for farming, though caution is advised during these brief spikes.</p>

    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Precipitation (IMERG):</span>  The region receives slightly below-average rainfall, around 20-25 cm annually. While the amount of rainfall is manageable, farmers will need to rely on irrigation to supplement natural water sources during the drier months, especially during late summer when rainfall tends to decrease.</p>

    <p class="p3"><span class="sp1">- Soil Moisture (SMAP):</span>  Soil moisture levels are moderate, generally between 20-30%, though certain areas are drier due to uneven rainfall distribution.

        <summary class="sum1">Detailed Information</summary>
        <p class="p4">Air Quality:</p>
        <p class="p5">The air quality in the DRS region is moderate, with an AQI fluctuating between 50-100 during most of the year【26†source】. Occasional spikes in pollution are observed, especially in urban areas and regions close to industrial activity. These pollution spikes are often due to emissions from factories and vehicular traffic, but overall, the air quality is suitable for farming most of the time. However, farmers should monitor air quality closely during these short-term pollution events, as they can temporarily reduce visibility and affect outdoor work.</p>
        <p class="p4">Precipitation (IMERG):</p>
        <p class="p5">According to IMERG data, the DRS region receives about 20-25 cm of rainfall annually, which is slightly below average for the region【37†source】【38†source】. This level of precipitation, while sufficient for farming, requires careful water management, especially during the drier months when rainfall decreases significantly. Farmers in DRS must ensure that their irrigation systems are functioning effectively to supplement natural rainfall and maintain soil moisture throughout the growing season.</p>
        <p class="p4">Soil Moisture (SMAP):</p>
        <p class="p5">SMAP data indicates that soil moisture levels in DRS are moderate, generally ranging from **20-30%**【38†source】. However, certain areas, particularly those with less access to irrigation, may experience periods of dryness due to uneven rainfall distribution. Farmers should prioritize irrigation in drier patches and regularly monitor soil moisture levels to avoid crop stress. SMAP data can be used to track soil moisture and make real-time adjustments to irrigation practices.</p>
        <p class="p4">Vegetation Growth (MODIS):</p>
        <p class="p5">MODIS satellite imagery shows healthy vegetation growth across most parts of the DRS region【39†source】. However, areas that receive less rainfall or where soil moisture is not properly managed may show early signs of vegetation stress. By utilizing MODIS data, farmers can monitor the growth of their crops and intervene when necessary, adjusting water and nutrient inputs to support optimal growth. Early detection of stress through satellite data allows farmers to address potential issues before they impact overall yields.</p>
        <p class="p4">Temperature:</p>
        <p class="p5">The DRS region experiences warm summers, with average temperatures ranging between 25°C and 35°C during the peak growing season. These temperatures, while suitable for many crops, also increase the risk of evapotranspiration, which can lead to water loss from both soil and plants. Farmers should closely monitor temperature fluctuations and adjust irrigation schedules to compensate for increased water evaporation during the hottest months. Additionally, cooler temperatures in the spring and fall extend the growing season, providing flexibility for crop rotation and longer harvesting periods.</p>
        <p class="p4">Flood and Drought Monitoring:</p>
        <p class="p5">While the DRS region is less prone to flooding, it does face occasional drought conditions during extended dry spells. According to Landsat and ECOSTRESS data, some areas in DRS are vulnerable to drought, especially during the summer when water demand increases【38†source】. Farmers can use these tools to track changes in water availability and adjust their irrigation practices accordingly. Drought-tolerant crops or water-efficient farming techniques can also help mitigate the impact of dry periods.</p>
        <p class="p4">Evapotranspiration:</p>
        <p class="p5">Evapotranspiration rates in DRS increase during the summer months, leading to a higher demand for water. ECOSTRESS and MODIS data show that the combination of high temperatures and moderate precipitation results in significant water loss through evaporation from the soil and transpiration from crops【39†source】. Farmers should monitor evapotranspiration closely and adjust their irrigation schedules to ensure that crops retain enough moisture, especially during the hottest parts of the growing season. Proper water management will help reduce the risk of water stress and ensure healthy crop growth.</p>
        <p class="p4">Overall Condition:</p>
        <p class="p5">Moderate conditions. Farming in the DRS region is viable, but it requires careful attention to water management, especially during the hotter months when evapotranspiration rates increase. Farmers should monitor air quality during short-term pollution spikes and be proactive in maintaining soil moisture through efficient irrigation systems. By utilizing satellite data from IMERG, SMAP, and MODIS, farmers can optimize their crop management practices, ensuring that they respond to environmental changes in real-time. With these strategies, the DRS region can sustain healthy crop production throughout the growing season.</p>
