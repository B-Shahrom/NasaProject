        <summary class="sum1">Detailed Information</summary>
        <p class="p4">Air Quality:</p>
        <p class="p5">The air quality in Khatlon is poor, with an AQI (Air Quality Index) reaching unhealthy levels, particularly around industrial areas like Bokhtar. AQI levels often reach 158, with elevated levels of PM2.5 from both industrial activities and natural dust storms【28†source】. High PM2.5 levels pose serious risks not only to human health but also to crops, as fine particulate matter can damage the leaves of plants, reduce photosynthesis, and affect overall plant health. Farmers in this region need to be cautious when working outdoors during high-pollution periods and may need to take protective measures for crops, such as temporary coverings during severe dust storms.</p>
        <p class="p4">Precipitation (IMERG):</p>
        <p class="p5">Khatlon is experiencing critically low levels of precipitation, with annual rainfall significantly below the expected average. IMERG data shows that rainfall in Khatlon is well below the required levels for healthy crop growth, often failing to reach even 15-20 cm in a given year【37†source】【38†source】. This lack of water poses a severe challenge for agriculture, as it directly impacts irrigation, soil moisture retention, and crop vitality. Without sufficient rainfall, farmers are left to rely on limited water sources, many of which are already strained.</p>
        <p class="p4">Soil Moisture (SMAP):</p>
        <p class="p5">SMAP data reveals that soil moisture levels in Khatlon are critically low, often dipping below 15%, which is insufficient for sustaining most crops【38†source】. This aridity makes it difficult for plants to absorb the water they need from the soil, leading to stunted growth and, in many cases, crop failure. With such low soil moisture levels, farmers in Khatlon are advised to avoid planting water-intensive crops and instead focus on drought-resistant varieties. Efforts to improve soil health through mulching or organic matter addition could help retain more moisture, but the overall scarcity of water is a major obstacle.</p>
        <p class="p4">Vegetation Growth (MODIS):</p>
        <p class="p5">According to MODIS satellite imagery, vegetation growth across Khatlon is severely impacted by the combined effects of poor air quality, low precipitation, and insufficient soil moisture【39†source】. Large areas of farmland are showing signs of stress, with many crops failing to thrive under the region’s current conditions. The lack of green cover indicates that many fields are either barren or sparsely populated with struggling plants. This trend is likely to continue unless there is a substantial improvement in water availability and soil conditions.</p>
        <p class="p4">Temperature:</p>
        <p class="p5">Khatlon experiences hot summers, with temperatures often exceeding 35°C during the peak season. These high temperatures increase evapotranspiration rates, further depleting soil moisture and making irrigation even more critical for sustaining crops. The combination of intense heat and low rainfall exacerbates the water stress in the region, particularly for crops that are not well-adapted to dry climates.</p>
        <p class="p4">Flood and Drought Monitoring:</p>
        <p class="p5">Khatlon is highly susceptible to droughts, with Landsat and ECOSTRESS data highlighting the region’s vulnerability to long-term dry periods【38†source】. While the risk of flooding is relatively low due to the lack of rainfall, the persistent drought conditions pose a much greater challenge. Farmers need to monitor drought patterns closely and plan accordingly, focusing on crops that require minimal water and using drought-tolerant farming techniques like rainwater harvesting or soil moisture conservation.</p>
        <p class="p4">Evapotranspiration:</p>
        <p class="p5">The high temperatures and dry conditions in Khatlon lead to increased evapotranspiration, which refers to the combined loss of water from the soil and through plant transpiration【39†source】. Monitoring evapotranspiration rates using ECOSTRESS and MODIS data is crucial for farmers to ensure that their crops retain enough moisture, especially during the hottest months. Evapotranspiration data can help farmers optimize their irrigation schedules and prevent excessive water loss, though this remains difficult with the region’s limited water supply.</p>
        <p class="p4">Overall Condition:</p>
        <p class="p5">Not suitable for farming. The Khatlon region faces severe environmental challenges, including high air pollution, extremely low precipitation, poor soil moisture, and high temperatures, all of which combine to make farming extremely difficult. Without adequate water sources and mitigation strategies, most crops will struggle to survive, and farmers are likely to experience significant yield losses. Farmers are advised to avoid planting water-dependent crops and should consider shifting towards drought-resistant varieties or implementing advanced water-saving techniques to make the best use of scarce resources.</p>
